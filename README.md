# Raycasting-Engine

Initial idea is to create fully working raycasting engine (simplified as in Wolfenstein 3D)\
Then add support of textures, different maps(levels), serialization\
After that I will try to create some kind of FPS shooter on base of this engine(maybe with some RPG elements)\

## Current progress
Implemented raycasting\
Demo:
