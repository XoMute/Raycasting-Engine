# Raycasting-Engine

Initial idea is to create fully working raycasting engine (simplified as in Wolfenstein 3D)\
Then add support of textures, different maps(levels), serialization\
After that I will try to create some kind of FPS shooter on base of this engine(maybe with some RPG elements)

## Current progress
Implemented raycasting and 3D visualization of it (without textures yet)

## TODO:
* Strafing
* Proper collision detection
* Textures
