# Raycasting-Engine

Initial idea is to create fully working raycasting engine (simplified as in Wolfenstein 3D)\
Then add support of textures, different maps(levels), serialization\
After that I will try to create some kind of FPS shooter on base of this engine(maybe with some RPG elements)

## Current progress
* Implemented raycasting and 3D visualization of it (without textures yet)
* Implemented proper collision detection with some sort of "wall sliding"
* Improved general looks and added smoothing property (**FXAA** lol)
